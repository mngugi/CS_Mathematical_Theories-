**1.0 Set Theory**

A set is an unordered collection of discrete objects (called elements or members).

Set notation uses curly braces {}

Elements are separated by commas

Order does not matter

Duplicates are ignored

Example:
A set of natural numbers:

A = {0, 1, 3, 6, 9}

Here:

0 ∈ A (0 is an element of A)

2 ∉ A (2 is not in A)
