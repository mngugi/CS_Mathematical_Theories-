### 1.0 Set Theory

A **set** is an unordered collection of discrete objects (called *elements* or *members*).

Key properties of sets:
- Notation uses curly braces `{}`  
- Elements are separated by commas  
- Order does not matter  
- Duplicates are ignored  

#### Example  
A set of natural numbers:  

`A = {0, 1, 3, 6, 9}`  

#### Membership  
- `0 ∈ A` → 0 is an element of A  
- `2 ∉ A` → 2 is not an element of A
