# Definition of an Odd Integer

An integer n is odd if there exists an integer k such that

n = 2k + 1

This means n is not divisible by 2; it leaves a remainder of 1.

# About the integer k in n = 2k + 1

- If n = 2k + 1 and n is an integer, then k = (n - 1) / 2.
- k may be positive, zero, or negative.
- k is unique: if 2k + 1 = 2k' + 1 then k = k'.

# Parity consequences

- If k is even (k = 2m), then n = 2*(2m) + 1 = 4m + 1.
- If k is odd (k = 2m + 1), then n = 2*(2m + 1) + 1 = 4m + 3.

# How k is used in proofs

- Sum of two odd numbers:
  If n = 2k + 1 and m = 2l + 1, then
  n + m = 2k + 1 + 2l + 1 = 2(k + l + 1) --> sum is even.

- Sum of an odd and an even number:
  If n = 2k + 1 (odd) and m = 2l (even), then
  n + m = 2k + 1 + 2l = 2(k + l) + 1 --> sum is odd.

# Examples

- n = 7 --> k = 3 --> 7 = 2 * 3 + 1
- n = 1 --> k = 0 --> 1 = 2 * 0 + 1
- n = -5 --> k = -3 --> -5 = 2 * (-3) + 1
- Pick k = 4 --> n = 2 * 4 + 1 = 9 --> 9 is odd

# Proof: Sum of Two Odd Numbers is Even

- Let n1 = 2k1 + 1, n2 = 2k2 + 1
- Add: n1 + n2 = 2k1 + 1 + 2k2 + 1
- Simplify: n1 + n2 = 2(k1 + k2 + 1)
- Let k3 = k1 + k2 + 1
- Then: n1 + n2 = 2k3 --> sum is even
