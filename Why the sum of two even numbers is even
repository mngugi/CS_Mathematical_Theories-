Definition of an Even Integer

An integer n is even if and only if there exists an integer k such that

n = 2k

This means that n is divisible by 2, and its remainder upon division by 2 is 0.

About the integer k in the equation n = 2k

Definition / immediate fact

If n = 2k and n is an integer, then k = n / 2.

The requirement “there exists an integer k” means exactly that n / 2 must be an integer.

What k can be

k may be positive, zero, or negative.

k is unique for a given n: if 2k = 2k' then 2(k - k') = 0 so k - k' = 0 and k = k'.

Parity consequences (how properties of k affect n)

If k is even, say k = 2m, then n = 2(2m) = 4m. So n is divisible by 4.

If k is odd, say k = 2m + 1, then n = 2(2m + 1) = 4m + 2. So n ≡ 2 (mod 4).

How k is used in proofs

Sum of two even integers: if n = 2k and m = 2ℓ then

n + m = 2k + 2ℓ = 2(k + ℓ)

so the sum is even because k + ℓ is an integer.

Multiples: n = 2k shows n is a multiple of 2; more generally, if k is a multiple of t then n is a multiple of 2t.

Examples

n = 8
Then k = 8 / 2 = 4.
Check: 8 = 2 * 4.

n = 0
Then k = 0.
Check: 0 = 2 * 0.

n = -6
Then k = -6 / 2 = -3.
Check: -6 = 2 * (-3).

Pick k = 3
Then n = 2 * 3 = 6 (so 6 is even; because k is odd, 6 ≡ 2 (mod 4)).
