# Definition of an Even Integer

An integer n is even if there exists an integer k such that

n = 2k

This means n is divisible by 2, with remainder 0.

# About the integer k in n = 2k

- If n = 2k and n is an integer, then k = n / 2.
- k may be positive, zero, or negative.
- k is unique: if 2k = 2k' then k = k'.

# Parity consequences

- If k is even (k = 2m), then n = 4m.
- If k is odd (k = 2m + 1), then n = 4m + 2.

# How k is used in proofs

- Sum of two even numbers:
  If n = 2k and m = 2l, then
  n + m = 2(k + l)  --> sum is even.

- Multiples:
  n = 2k is a multiple of 2.
  If k is a multiple of t, then n is a multiple of 2t.

# Examples

- n = 8 --> k = 4 --> 8 = 2 * 4
- n = 0 --> k = 0 --> 0 = 2 * 0
- n = -6 --> k = -3 --> -6 = 2 * (-3)
- Pick k = 3 --> n = 6 --> 6 is even; 6 â‰¡ 2 mod 4

# Proof: Sum of Two Even Numbers is Even

- Let n1 = 2k1, n2 = 2k2
- Add: n1 + n2 = 2k1 + 2k2
- Factor: n1 + n2 = 2(k1 + k2)
- Let k3 = k1 + k2
- Then: n1 + n2 = 2k3 --> sum is even
