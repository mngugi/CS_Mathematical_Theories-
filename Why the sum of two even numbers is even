📘 Definition of an Even Integer

An integer n is considered even if and only if there exists an integer k such that:

n=2k
n=2k

This implies that n is divisible by 2, and its remainder upon division by 2 is zero.

🔍 Understanding the Integer k in the Equation n = 2k
✅ Immediate Fact

If n = 2k and n is an integer, then:

k=n2
k=
2
n
	​


The requirement "there exists an integer k" means exactly that n / 2 must be an integer.

🔢 Possible Values of k

k may be positive, zero, or negative.

k is unique for a given n: if 2k = 2k', then 2(k - k') = 0, so k - k' = 0 and k = k'.

🔄 Parity Consequences (How Properties of k Affect n)

If k is even, say k = 2m, then:

n=2(2m)=4m
n=2(2m)=4m

So, n is divisible by 4.

If k is odd, say k = 2m + 1, then:

n=2(2m+1)=4m+2
n=2(2m+1)=4m+2

So, n ≡ 2 (mod 4).

🧩 Applications of k in Mathematical Proofs
➕ Sum of Two Even Integers

Let n = 2k and m = 2ℓ. Then:

n+m=2k+2ℓ=2(k+ℓ)
n+m=2k+2ℓ=2(k+ℓ)

Thus, the sum is even because k + ℓ is an integer.

🔢 Multiples

Since n = 2k, n is a multiple of 2. More generally, if k is a multiple of t, then n is a multiple of 2t.

🧪 Examples

n = 8

Then:

k=82=4
k=
2
8
	​

=4

Check: 8 = 2 * 4

n = 0

Then:

k=0
k=0

Check: 0 = 2 * 0

n = -6

Then:

k=−62=−3
k=
2
−6
	​

=−3

Check: -6 = 2 * (-3)

Pick k = 3

Then:

n=2∗3=6
n=2∗3=6

Since k is odd, n ≡ 2 (mod 4).

📘 Proof Idea: Why the Sum of Two Even Numbers is Even

Let’s take two even integers, n₁ and n₂. By definition:

n₁ = 2k₁ for some integer k₁

n₂ = 2k₂ for some integer k₂

Step 1: Add Them
n1+n2=2k1+2k2
n

	​

+n

	​

=2k

+2k

Step 2: Factor Out 2
n1+n2=2(k1+k2)
n

	​

+n

	​

=2(k

	​

+k

	​

)
Step 3: Reason About the Parentheses

Since k₁ + k₂ is an integer (the sum of integers is always an integer), let’s call it k₃ = k₁ + k₂.

n1+n2=2k3
n
1
	​

+n
2
	​

=2k

	​

✅ Conclusion

n₁ + n₂ is even because it is 2 times some integer k₃.
